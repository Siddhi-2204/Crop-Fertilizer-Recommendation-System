# Crop-Fertilizer-Recommendation-System

This project uses Machine Learning to recommend the best crop and fertilizer based on soil and climate conditions.  

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `notebooks/` â†’ Jupyter Notebooks for crop and fertilizer prediction  
- `datasets/` â†’ CSV files used for training and testing  

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib  

## ðŸ“Š Models
- Decision Tree Classifier for Crop Recommendation  
- Decision Tree Classifier for Fertilizer Prediction

## ðŸŽ¯Applications
- Helps farmers choose the best crop based on soil and weather.
- Recommends fertilizers to improve productivity.
- Can be extended to build a web app for real-time recommendations.
